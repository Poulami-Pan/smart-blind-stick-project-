This project is an IoT project named "SMART BIND STICK". 
Components Required:-Arduino UNO,USB cable for uploading the code,,Jumper wires,HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor,Buzzer,DC batteries,a stick
Procedure:-To create a smart blind stick with Arduino Uno, integrate ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. If any obstacle is going to be coming in front of the sensor , the buzzar is going to make sound.
